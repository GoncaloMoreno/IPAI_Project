H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system. However, Proxima Centauri has long been known as a flare star, making it a template case to explore the potential effects of variability on the planet's properties. We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths. We propose Cycle 6 ACA monitoring of the Proxima Centauri system to 1) explore the nature of millimeter flares from M dwarf stars and (2) place deep limits on the presence and amount of dust in the system, if any exists.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare.

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system. However, Proxima Centauri has long been known as a flare star, making it a template case to explore the potential effects of variability on the planet's properties. We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths.

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths.

The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths.

The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive.

We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range.

The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare.

The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity.

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system. However, Proxima Centauri has long been known as a flare star, making it a template case to explore the potential effects of variability on the planet's properties. We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths. We propose Cycle 6 ACA monitoring of the Proxima Centauri system to 1) explore the nature of millimeter flares from M dwarf stars and (2) place deep limits on the presence and amount of dust in the system, if any exists.

The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths.

The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system. However, Proxima Centauri has long been known as a flare star, making it a template case to explore the potential effects of variability on the planet's properties. We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths. We propose Cycle 6 ACA monitoring of the Proxima Centauri system to 1) explore the nature of millimeter flares from M dwarf stars and (2) place deep limits on the presence and amount of dust in the system, if any exists.

The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference.

About 20 independent velocity components at 4.7–10.9 kpc from the Galactic center were identified. Their column density and excitation temperature estimated from the absorption study, as well as the CO intensity distributions obtained from the FUGIN survey, indicate that the components with τ ≲1 correspond to diffuse clouds or cloud outer edges. Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components. The kinetic temperature empirically expected from the high HCN/HNC isomer ratio (≳4) reaches ≳40 K and the corresponding thermal width accounts for the line widths of the narrow-line components. CN-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons have tight and linear correlations within the groups. The CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio showed a dispersion as large as 3 orders of magnitude with a smaller ratio in a smaller N(HCO<SUP>+</SUP>) (or lower A <SUB>V</SUB>) range. Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO<SUP>+</SUP> absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption. This may be explained by the mixture of clumpy CO emitters not resolved with the ∼1 pc single-dish beam surrounded by extended components with a very low CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio (i.e., CO-poor gas). ...(3)",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs). While scattered, small sky patch searches have been made, no systematic galaxy wide survey that can place such searches on a statistical firm footing has ever been conducted. We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum. Embedded star formation will manifest via outflowing, shocked, and warm gas component with little or no evidence of cold gas towards dense cores. By weeding out such masqueraders, and revealing the extent of fragmentation in all HMSCs, a feat only achievable with a survey machine like ALMA in an ambitious but highly economical <10 hrs main array time, we will for the first time reveal the truly massive starless cores.

We detected 17 species (CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, C<SUP>18</SUP>O, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, HCO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, C<SUB>2</SUB>H, c-C<SUB>3</SUB>H, c-C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>, CN, HCN, HNC, CS, SO, SiO, and C) and set upper limits to 18 species as reference values for chemical models. About 20 independent velocity components at 4.7–10.9 kpc from the Galactic center were identified. Their column density and excitation temperature estimated from the absorption study, as well as the CO intensity distributions obtained from the FUGIN survey, indicate that the components with τ ≲1 correspond to diffuse clouds or cloud outer edges. Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components. The kinetic temperature empirically expected from the high HCN/HNC isomer ratio (≳4) reaches ≳40 K and the corresponding thermal width accounts for the line widths of the narrow-line components. CN-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons have tight and linear correlations within the groups. The CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio showed a dispersion as large as 3 orders of magnitude with a smaller ratio in a smaller N(HCO<SUP>+</SUP>) (or lower A <SUB>V</SUB>) range. Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO<SUP>+</SUP> absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption. This may be explained by the mixture of clumpy CO emitters not resolved with the ∼1 pc single-dish beam surrounded by extended components with a very low CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio (i.e., CO-poor gas). ...(3)",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF).

Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components.

Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO<SUP>+</SUP> absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption.

About 20 independent velocity components at 4.7–10.9 kpc from the Galactic center were identified. Their column density and excitation temperature estimated from the absorption study, as well as the CO intensity distributions obtained from the FUGIN survey, indicate that the components with τ ≲1 correspond to diffuse clouds or cloud outer edges. Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components. The kinetic temperature empirically expected from the high HCN/HNC isomer ratio (≳4) reaches ≳40 K and the corresponding thermal width accounts for the line widths of the narrow-line components. CN-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons have tight and linear correlations within the groups. The CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio showed a dispersion as large as 3 orders of magnitude with a smaller ratio in a smaller N(HCO<SUP>+</SUP>) (or lower A <SUB>V</SUB>) range. Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO<SUP>+</SUP> absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption. This may be explained by the mixture of clumpy CO emitters not resolved with the ∼1 pc single-dish beam surrounded by extended components with a very low CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio (i.e., CO-poor gas). ...(3)",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF).

About 20 independent velocity components at 4.7–10.9 kpc from the Galactic center were identified. Their column density and excitation temperature estimated from the absorption study, as well as the CO intensity distributions obtained from the FUGIN survey, indicate that the components with τ ≲1 correspond to diffuse clouds or cloud outer edges. Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components. The kinetic temperature empirically expected from the high HCN/HNC isomer ratio (≳4) reaches ≳40 K and the corresponding thermal width accounts for the line widths of the narrow-line components. CN-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons have tight and linear correlations within the groups. The CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio showed a dispersion as large as 3 orders of magnitude with a smaller ratio in a smaller N(HCO<SUP>+</SUP>) (or lower A <SUB>V</SUB>) range. Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO<SUP>+</SUP> absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption. This may be explained by the mixture of clumpy CO emitters not resolved with the ∼1 pc single-dish beam surrounded by extended components with a very low CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio (i.e., CO-poor gas). ...(3)",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF).

G. S.","Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data toward QSO J1851+0035 (l = 33.°498, b = +0.°194) were used to study absorption lines by Galactic molecular gas. We detected 17 species (CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, C<SUP>18</SUP>O, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, HCO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, C<SUB>2</SUB>H, c-C<SUB>3</SUB>H, c-C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>, CN, HCN, HNC, CS, SO, SiO, and C) and set upper limits to 18 species as reference values for chemical models. About 20 independent velocity components at 4.7–10.9 kpc from the Galactic center were identified. Their column density and excitation temperature estimated from the absorption study, as well as the CO intensity distributions obtained from the FUGIN survey, indicate that the components with τ ≲1 correspond to diffuse clouds or cloud outer edges. Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components. The kinetic temperature empirically expected from the high HCN/HNC isomer ratio (≳4) reaches ≳40 K and the corresponding thermal width accounts for the line widths of the narrow-line components. CN-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons have tight and linear correlations within the groups. The CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio showed a dispersion as large as 3 orders of magnitude with a smaller ratio in a smaller N(HCO<SUP>+</SUP>) (or lower A <SUB>V</SUB>) range. Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO<SUP>+</SUP> absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption. This may be explained by the mixture of clumpy CO emitters not resolved with the ∼1 pc single-dish beam surrounded by extended components with a very low CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio (i.e., CO-poor gas). ...(3)",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs).

We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum. Embedded star formation will manifest via outflowing, shocked, and warm gas component with little or no evidence of cold gas towards dense cores.

We detected 17 species (CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, C<SUP>18</SUP>O, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, HCO, H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, C<SUB>2</SUB>H, c-C<SUB>3</SUB>H, c-C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>, CN, HCN, HNC, CS, SO, SiO, and C) and set upper limits to 18 species as reference values for chemical models. About 20 independent velocity components at 4.7–10.9 kpc from the Galactic center were identified. Their column density and excitation temperature estimated from the absorption study, as well as the CO intensity distributions obtained from the FUGIN survey, indicate that the components with τ ≲1 correspond to diffuse clouds or cloud outer edges. Simultaneous multiple-Gaussian fitting of CO J = 1–0 and J = 2–1 absorption lines shows that these are composed of narrow- and broad-line components. The kinetic temperature empirically expected from the high HCN/HNC isomer ratio (≳4) reaches ≳40 K and the corresponding thermal width accounts for the line widths of the narrow-line components. CN-bearing molecules and hydrocarbons have tight and linear correlations within the groups. The CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio showed a dispersion as large as 3 orders of magnitude with a smaller ratio in a smaller N(HCO<SUP>+</SUP>) (or lower A <SUB>V</SUB>) range. Some of the velocity components are detected in single-dish CO emission and ALMA HCO<SUP>+</SUP> absorption but without corresponding ALMA CO absorption. This may be explained by the mixture of clumpy CO emitters not resolved with the ∼1 pc single-dish beam surrounded by extended components with a very low CO/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance ratio (i.e., CO-poor gas). ...(3)",2021,"Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs). While scattered, small sky patch searches have been made, no systematic galaxy wide survey that can place such searches on a statistical firm footing has ever been conducted. We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum. Embedded star formation will manifest via outflowing, shocked, and warm gas component with little or no evidence of cold gas towards dense cores.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive.

The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range.

The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system. However, Proxima Centauri has long been known as a flare star, making it a template case to explore the potential effects of variability on the planet's properties. We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths. We propose Cycle 6 ACA monitoring of the Proxima Centauri system to 1) explore the nature of millimeter flares from M dwarf stars and (2) place deep limits on the presence and amount of dust in the system, if any exists. We will pair the millimeter observations from ALMA with simultaneous optical photometry from ground- and space-based observatories to determine the correlation between optical and millimeter flares, allowing for a thorough investigation of flare emission mechanisms at these wavelengths.",Proxima_m_06_7M,"Cranmer, Steven; Law, Nicholas; Boley, Aaron; Matthews, Jaymie; Howard, Ward; Weinberger, Alycia; Kowalski, Adam; Hughes, Anna; Wilner, David;",4.373588581629581,2024-08-21T18:10:02.819

The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity.

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system. However, Proxima Centauri has long been known as a flare star, making it a template case to explore the potential effects of variability on the planet's properties. We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths. We propose Cycle 6 ACA monitoring of the Proxima Centauri system to 1) explore the nature of millimeter flares from M dwarf stars and (2) place deep limits on the presence and amount of dust in the system, if any exists.

The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. Low-mass stars might offer today the best opportunities to detect and characterize planetary systems, especially those harbouring close-in low-mass temperate planets. Among those stars, TRAPPIST-1 is exceptional since it has seven Earth-sized planets, of which three could sustain liquid water on their surfaces. Here we present new and deep ALMA observations of TRAPPIST-1 to look for an exo-Kuiper belt which can provide clues about the formation and architecture of this system. Our observations at 0.88 mm did not detect dust emission, but can place an upper limit of 23 µJy if the belt is smaller than 4 au, and 0.15 mJy if resolved and 100 au in radius. These limits correspond to low dust masses of ∼10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, which are expected after 8 Gyr of collisional evolution unless the system was born with a &gt;20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> belt of 100 km-sized planetesimals beyond 40 au or suffered a dynamical instability. This 20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> mass upper limit is comparable to the combined mass in TRAPPIST-1 planets, thus it is possible that most of the available solid mass in this system was used to form the known planets. A similar analysis of the ALMA data on Proxima Cen leads us to conclude that a belt born with a mass ≳1 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> in 100 km-sized planetesimals could explain its putative outer belt at 30 au. We recommend that future characterizations of debris discs around low-mass stars should focus on nearby and young systems if possible. ...(3)",2017,"After our discovery a few months ago of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of the closest star, Proxima Centauri (Anglada-Escude et al. 2016), a large effort is being carried out to characterize the planet and the star-planetary system. Our calculations indicate that there are reasonable expectations that Proxima Centauri is surrounded by a compact Kuiper-belt analog with a flux density high enough to be imaged with ALMA. We request DDT observing time in band 6 to attempt its detection with ACA and imaging with the 12-m array. If successful, our observations would provide valuable information on the dynamical history and architecture of the planetary system.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. Low-mass stars might offer today the best opportunities to detect and characterize planetary systems, especially those harbouring close-in low-mass temperate planets. Among those stars, TRAPPIST-1 is exceptional since it has seven Earth-sized planets, of which three could sustain liquid water on their surfaces. Here we present new and deep ALMA observations of TRAPPIST-1 to look for an exo-Kuiper belt which can provide clues about the formation and architecture of this system. Our observations at 0.88 mm did not detect dust emission, but can place an upper limit of 23 µJy if the belt is smaller than 4 au, and 0.15 mJy if resolved and 100 au in radius. These limits correspond to low dust masses of ∼10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, which are expected after 8 Gyr of collisional evolution unless the system was born with a &gt;20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> belt of 100 km-sized planetesimals beyond 40 au or suffered a dynamical instability. This 20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> mass upper limit is comparable to the combined mass in TRAPPIST-1 planets, thus it is possible that most of the available solid mass in this system was used to form the known planets. A similar analysis of the ALMA data on Proxima Cen leads us to conclude that a belt born with a mass ≳1 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> in 100 km-sized planetesimals could explain its putative outer belt at 30 au. We recommend that future characterizations of debris discs around low-mass stars should focus on nearby and young systems if possible. ...(3)",2017,"After our discovery a few months ago of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of the closest star, Proxima Centauri (Anglada-Escude et al. 2016), a large effort is being carried out to characterize the planet and the star-planetary system.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. Low-mass stars might offer today the best opportunities to detect and characterize planetary systems, especially those harbouring close-in low-mass temperate planets. Among those stars, TRAPPIST-1 is exceptional since it has seven Earth-sized planets, of which three could sustain liquid water on their surfaces. Here we present new and deep ALMA observations of TRAPPIST-1 to look for an exo-Kuiper belt which can provide clues about the formation and architecture of this system. Our observations at 0.88 mm did not detect dust emission, but can place an upper limit of 23 µJy if the belt is smaller than 4 au, and 0.15 mJy if resolved and 100 au in radius. These limits correspond to low dust masses of ∼10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, which are expected after 8 Gyr of collisional evolution unless the system was born with a &gt;20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> belt of 100 km-sized planetesimals beyond 40 au or suffered a dynamical instability. This 20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> mass upper limit is comparable to the combined mass in TRAPPIST-1 planets, thus it is possible that most of the available solid mass in this system was used to form the known planets. A similar analysis of the ALMA data on Proxima Cen leads us to conclude that a belt born with a mass ≳1 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> in 100 km-sized planetesimals could explain its putative outer belt at 30 au. We recommend that future characterizations of debris discs around low-mass stars should focus on nearby and young systems if possible. ...(3)",2017,"After our discovery a few months ago of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of the closest star, Proxima Centauri (Anglada-Escude et al. 2016), a large effort is being carried out to characterize the planet and the star-planetary system. Our calculations indicate that there are reasonable expectations that Proxima Centauri is surrounded by a compact Kuiper-belt analog with a flux density high enough to be imaged with ALMA. We request DDT observing time in band 6 to attempt its detection with ACA and imaging with the 12-m array. If successful, our observations would provide valuable information on the dynamical history and architecture of the planetary system. They would allow us to determine the orbital inclination and the true mass of the Proxima b planet,and to characterize its debris environment, which would affect its habitability, its prospective direct detection in the optical, and even the feasibility of a visit using microprobes.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. Low-mass stars might offer today the best opportunities to detect and characterize planetary systems, especially those harbouring close-in low-mass temperate planets. Among those stars, TRAPPIST-1 is exceptional since it has seven Earth-sized planets, of which three could sustain liquid water on their surfaces. Here we present new and deep ALMA observations of TRAPPIST-1 to look for an exo-Kuiper belt which can provide clues about the formation and architecture of this system. Our observations at 0.88 mm did not detect dust emission, but can place an upper limit of 23 µJy if the belt is smaller than 4 au, and 0.15 mJy if resolved and 100 au in radius. These limits correspond to low dust masses of ∼10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, which are expected after 8 Gyr of collisional evolution unless the system was born with a &gt;20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> belt of 100 km-sized planetesimals beyond 40 au or suffered a dynamical instability. This 20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> mass upper limit is comparable to the combined mass in TRAPPIST-1 planets, thus it is possible that most of the available solid mass in this system was used to form the known planets. A similar analysis of the ALMA data on Proxima Cen leads us to conclude that a belt born with a mass ≳1 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> in 100 km-sized planetesimals could explain its putative outer belt at 30 au. We recommend that future characterizations of debris discs around low-mass stars should focus on nearby and young systems if possible. ...(3)",2017,"After our discovery a few months ago of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of the closest star, Proxima Centauri (Anglada-Escude et al. 2016), a large effort is being carried out to characterize the planet and the star-planetary system. Our calculations indicate that there are reasonable expectations that Proxima Centauri is surrounded by a compact Kuiper-belt analog with a flux density high enough to be imaged with ALMA. We request DDT observing time in band 6 to attempt its detection with ACA and imaging with the 12-m array. If successful, our observations would provide valuable information on the dynamical history and architecture of the planetary system.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. Low-mass stars might offer today the best opportunities to detect and characterize planetary systems, especially those harbouring close-in low-mass temperate planets. Among those stars, TRAPPIST-1 is exceptional since it has seven Earth-sized planets, of which three could sustain liquid water on their surfaces. Here we present new and deep ALMA observations of TRAPPIST-1 to look for an exo-Kuiper belt which can provide clues about the formation and architecture of this system. Our observations at 0.88 mm did not detect dust emission, but can place an upper limit of 23 µJy if the belt is smaller than 4 au, and 0.15 mJy if resolved and 100 au in radius. These limits correspond to low dust masses of ∼10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, which are expected after 8 Gyr of collisional evolution unless the system was born with a &gt;20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> belt of 100 km-sized planetesimals beyond 40 au or suffered a dynamical instability. This 20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> mass upper limit is comparable to the combined mass in TRAPPIST-1 planets, thus it is possible that most of the available solid mass in this system was used to form the known planets. A similar analysis of the ALMA data on Proxima Cen leads us to conclude that a belt born with a mass ≳1 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> in 100 km-sized planetesimals could explain its putative outer belt at 30 au. We recommend that future characterizations of debris discs around low-mass stars should focus on nearby and young systems if possible. ...(3)",2017,"After our discovery a few months ago of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of the closest star, Proxima Centauri (Anglada-Escude et al. 2016), a large effort is being carried out to characterize the planet and the star-planetary system.

Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. Low-mass stars might offer today the best opportunities to detect and characterize planetary systems, especially those harbouring close-in low-mass temperate planets. Among those stars, TRAPPIST-1 is exceptional since it has seven Earth-sized planets, of which three could sustain liquid water on their surfaces. Here we present new and deep ALMA observations of TRAPPIST-1 to look for an exo-Kuiper belt which can provide clues about the formation and architecture of this system. Our observations at 0.88 mm did not detect dust emission, but can place an upper limit of 23 µJy if the belt is smaller than 4 au, and 0.15 mJy if resolved and 100 au in radius. These limits correspond to low dust masses of ∼10<SUP>-5</SUP> to 10<SUP>-2</SUP> M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, which are expected after 8 Gyr of collisional evolution unless the system was born with a &gt;20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> belt of 100 km-sized planetesimals beyond 40 au or suffered a dynamical instability. This 20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> mass upper limit is comparable to the combined mass in TRAPPIST-1 planets, thus it is possible that most of the available solid mass in this system was used to form the known planets. A similar analysis of the ALMA data on Proxima Cen leads us to conclude that a belt born with a mass ≳1 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> in 100 km-sized planetesimals could explain its putative outer belt at 30 au. We recommend that future characterizations of debris discs around low-mass stars should focus on nearby and young systems if possible. ...(3)",2017,"After our discovery a few months ago of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of the closest star, Proxima Centauri (Anglada-Escude et al. 2016), a large effort is being carried out to characterize the planet and the star-planetary system. Our calculations indicate that there are reasonable expectations that Proxima Centauri is surrounded by a compact Kuiper-belt analog with a flux density high enough to be imaged with ALMA. We request DDT observing time in band 6 to attempt its detection with ACA and imaging with the 12-m array. If successful, our observations would provide valuable information on the dynamical history and architecture of the planetary system. They would allow us to determine the orbital inclination and the true mass of the Proxima b planet,and to characterize its debris environment, which would affect its habitability, its prospective direct detection in the optical, and even the feasibility of a visit using microprobes.

We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system. However, Proxima Centauri has long been known as a flare star, making it a template case to explore the potential effects of variability on the planet's properties. We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths. We propose Cycle 6 ACA monitoring of the Proxima Centauri system to 1) explore the nature of millimeter flares from M dwarf stars and (2) place deep limits on the presence and amount of dust in the system, if any exists. We will pair the millimeter observations from ALMA with simultaneous optical photometry from ground- and space-based observatories to determine the correlation between optical and millimeter flares, allowing for a thorough investigation of flare emission mechanisms at these wavelengths.",Proxima_o_06_7M,"Cranmer, Steven; Law, Nicholas; Boley, Aaron; Matthews, Jaymie; Howard, Ward; Weinberger, Alycia; Kowalski, Adam; Hughes, Anna; Wilner, David;",4.3420284929313775,2024-08-21T18:10:02.819

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system. However, Proxima Centauri has long been known as a flare star, making it a template case to explore the potential effects of variability on the planet's properties. We recently detected a flaring event in ALMA ACA observations during which the star brightened by a factor of 1000x over 1 minute. While this event throws doubt on previous claims of multiple dust belts in the system, it also opens a new observational window on the mechanisms responsible for stellar flares, since the flaring properties of M dwarfs have not been well-studied at these wavelengths. We propose Cycle 6 ACA monitoring of the Proxima Centauri system to 1) explore the nature of millimeter flares from M dwarf stars and (2) place deep limits on the presence and amount of dust in the system, if any exists.

H.","Context. Due to their wide wavelength coverage across the millimeter to centimeter (mm-cm) range and their increased sensitivity, modern interferometric arrays facilitate observations of the thermal and non-thermal radiation that is emitted from different layers in the outer atmospheres of stars. <BR /> Aims: We study the spectral energy distribution (S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν)) of main-sequence stars based on archival observations in the mm-cm range with the aim to study their atmospheric stratification as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Methods: The main-sequence stars with significant detection in mm bands were identified in the ALMA Science Archive. These data were then complemented with spectral flux data in the extreme ultraviolet to cm range as compiled from various catalogues and observatory archives. We compared the resultant S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of each star with a photospheric emission model (S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν)) calculated with the PHOENIX code. The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

The departures of S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) from S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) were quantified in terms of a spectral flux excess parameter (ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB>) and studied as a function of stellar type. <BR /> Results: The initial sample consists of 12 main-sequence stars across a broad range of spectral types from A1 to M3.5 and the Sun-as-a-star as reference. The stars with T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K (F-M type) showed a systematically higher S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) than S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) in the mm-cm range. Their ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> exhibits a monotonic rise with decreasing frequency. The steepness of this rise is higher for cooler stars in the T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 3000-7000 K range, although the single fully convective star (T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 3000 K) in the sample deviates from this trend. Meanwhile, S<SUB>obs</SUB>(ν) of the A-type stars agrees with S<SUB>mod</SUB>(ν) within errors. <BR /> Conclusions: The systematically high ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> in F-M stars indicates hotter upper atmospheric layers, that is, a chromosphere and corona in these stars, like for the Sun. The mm-cm ΔS∕S<SUB>mod</SUB> spectrum offers a way to estimate the efficiency of the heating mechanisms across various outer atmospheric layers in main-sequence stars, and thereby to understand their structure and activity. We emphasise the need for dedicated surveys of main-sequence stars in the mm-cm range. We present millimeter, optical, and soft X-ray observations of a stellar flare with an energy squarely in the regime of typical X1 solar flares. The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope, the Iréné du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10<SUP>30.3 ± 0.2</SUP> and 10<SUP>28.9 ± 0.1</SUP> erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T = 11.0 ± 2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5 ± 2.2 × 10<SUP>49</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Güdel-Benz relation, but not during the flare. The millimeter luminosity is &gt;100× higher than that of an equivalent X1 solar flare and lasts only seconds instead of minutes as seen for solar flares. ...(1)",2021,"At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Centuari hosts the closest extrasolar planetary system.

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law).

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions. (3) investigate how globally collapse and stellar feedback influence CFE and the distributions of dense gas in proto-clusters.",I13471-6_a_03_TM1,"Bronfman, Leonardo; Yi, Hee-Weon; Juvela, Mika; Goldsmith, Paul; Garay, Guido; Wu, Yuefang; Qin, Sheng-Li; Tej, Anandmayee; Hirota, Tomoya; Kim, Kee-Tae; Yun, Hyeong-Sik; Zhang, Qizhou; Cunningham, Maria; Mardones, Diego; Kang, Sung-ju; Evans, Neal; Wu, Jingwen; Li, Pak Shing; Lee, Jeong-Eun; Wang, Ke; Toth, Laszlo Viktor; Ristorcelli, Isabelle; Liu, Sheng-Yuan; Tatematsu, Ken'ichi;",2.082654799418092,2024-08-21T18:10:02.819

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions. (3) investigate how globally collapse and stellar feedback influence CFE and the distributions of dense gas in proto-clusters.",I13471-6_a_03_TM1,"Bronfman, Leonardo; Yi, Hee-Weon; Juvela, Mika; Goldsmith, Paul; Garay, Guido; Wu, Yuefang; Qin, Sheng-Li; Tej, Anandmayee; Hirota, Tomoya; Kim, Kee-Tae; Yun, Hyeong-Sik; Zhang, Qizhou; Cunningham, Maria; Mardones, Diego; Kang, Sung-ju; Evans, Neal; Wu, Jingwen; Li, Pak Shing; Lee, Jeong-Eun; Wang, Ke; Toth, Laszlo Viktor; Ristorcelli, Isabelle; Liu, Sheng-Yuan; Tatematsu, Ken'ichi;",1.8750817898877032,2024-08-21T18:10:02.819

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions. (3) investigate how globally collapse and stellar feedback influence CFE and the distributions of dense gas in proto-clusters.",I13471-6_a_03_7M,"Bronfman, Leonardo; Yi, Hee-Weon; Juvela, Mika; Goldsmith, Paul; Garay, Guido; Wu, Yuefang; Qin, Sheng-Li; Tej, Anandmayee; Hirota, Tomoya; Kim, Kee-Tae; Yun, Hyeong-Sik; Zhang, Qizhou; Cunningham, Maria; Mardones, Diego; Kang, Sung-ju; Evans, Neal; Wu, Jingwen; Li, Pak Shing; Lee, Jeong-Eun; Wang, Ke; Toth, Laszlo Viktor; Ristorcelli, Isabelle; Liu, Sheng-Yuan; Tatematsu, Ken'ichi;",24.79094574360347,2024-08-21T18:10:02.819

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions. (3) investigate how globally collapse and stellar feedback influence CFE and the distributions of dense gas in proto-clusters.",I13471-6_a_03_7M,"Bronfman, Leonardo; Yi, Hee-Weon; Juvela, Mika; Goldsmith, Paul; Garay, Guido; Wu, Yuefang; Qin, Sheng-Li; Tej, Anandmayee; Hirota, Tomoya; Kim, Kee-Tae; Yun, Hyeong-Sik; Zhang, Qizhou; Cunningham, Maria; Mardones, Diego; Kang, Sung-ju; Evans, Neal; Wu, Jingwen; Li, Pak Shing; Lee, Jeong-Eun; Wang, Ke; Toth, Laszlo Viktor; Ristorcelli, Isabelle; Liu, Sheng-Yuan; Tatematsu, Ken'ichi;",25.175253490560237,2024-08-21T18:10:02.819

We identified dense gas structures based on the integrated intensity map of H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 1−0 emission, and then extracted the average spectra of all the structures to investigate their velocity components and gas kinematics. For the scaling relations between the velocity dispersion, σ, the effective radius, R, and the column density, N, of all the structures, σ − N * R always has a stronger correlation compared to σ − N and σ − R. There are significant correlations between velocity dispersion and column density, which may imply that the velocity dispersion originates in gravitational collapse, also revealed by the velocity gradients. The measured velocity gradients for dense gas structures in early-stage sources and late-stage sources are comparable, indicating gravitational collapse through all evolutionary stages. Late-stage sources do not have large-scale hub-filament structures, but the embedded dense gas structures in late-stage sources show similar kinematic modes to those in early- and middle-stage sources. These results may be explained by the multi-scale hub-filament structures in the clouds. We quantitatively estimated the velocity dispersion generated by the outflows, inflows, ionized gas pressure, and radiation pressure, and found that the ionized gas feedback is stronger than other feedback mechanisms. However, although feedback from HII regions is the strongest, it does not significantly affect the physical properties of the embedded dense gas structures. Combined with the conclusions in our previous work on cloud-clump scales, we suggest that although feedback from cloud to core scales will break up the original cloud complex, the substructures of the original complex can be reorganized into new gravitationally governed configurations around new gravitational centers. This process is accompanied by structural destruction and generation, and changes in gravitational centers, but gravitational collapse is always ongoing. ...(35)",2020,"In pioneering works (Gao & Solomon 2004; Wu et al. 2005), people found that the far-infrared luminosities in starburst galaxies and/or Galactic massive clumps followed a very tight, linear correlation with the luminosities of dense gas tracers like HCN (i.e., the dense gas star formation law). However, the origin of this correlation is far from well understood. Here we propose to use ALMA to systematically investigate the spatial distribution of various dense gas tracers in 146 proto-clusters in order to understand the origin of the dense gas star formation law. We aim to: (1) study how core formation efficiency (CFE) in proto-clusters changes with clump-averaged conditions and Galactocentric distances. (2) investigate the spatial distributions of various dense gas tracers to see how much of the total line luminosities of clumps come from dense cores, how much from unbound structures and how much from sub-thermal emission in very low density regions.

The fibers have a median length of ∼4500 au and a median width of ∼1400 au. Among these fibers, four are identified as ""fertile,"" each hosting at least three dense condensations, which are regarded as the ""seeds"" of star formation. While the detected cores are randomly spaced within the IRS 17 filament based on the 3 mm dust continuum image, periodic spacing (∼1600 au) of condensations is observed in the fertile fibers according to the 1.3 mm dust map, consistent with the predictions of linear isothermal cylinder fragmentation models. These findings underscore the crucial role of fibers in star formation and suggest a hierarchical fragmentation process that extends from the filament to the fibers and, ultimately, to the smallest-scale condensations. Leveraging the high resolution, sensitivity, and wide frequency coverage of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the QUARKS survey, standing for ""Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures"", is observing 139 massive star-forming clumps at ALMA Band 6 (λ ∼ 1.3 mm). This paper introduces the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7 m data of the QUARKS survey, describing the ACA observations and data reduction. Combining multi-wavelength data, we provide the first edition of QUARKS atlas, offering insights into the multiscale and multiphase interstellar medium in high-mass star formation. The ACA 1.3 mm catalog includes 207 continuum sources that are called ACA sources. Their gas kinetic temperatures are estimated using three formaldehyde transitions with a non-LTE radiation transfer model, and the mass and density are derived from a dust emission model. The ACA sources are massive (16–84 percentile values of 6–160 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), gravity-dominated (M ∝ R <SUP>1.1</SUP>) fragments within massive clumps, with supersonic turbulence ( ) and embedded star-forming protoclusters. We find a linear correlation between the masses of the fragments and the massive clumps, with a ratio of 6% between the two. When considering fragments as representative of dense gas, the ratio indicates a dense gas fraction (DGF) of 6%, although with a wide scatter ranging from 1% to 10%. If we consider the QUARKS massive clumps to be what is observed at various scales, then the size-independent DGF indicates a self-similar fragmentation or collapsing mode in protocluster formation. With the ACA data over four orders of magnitude of luminosity-to-mass ratio (L/M), we find that the DGF increases significantly with L/M, which indicates clump evolutionary stage. We observed a limited fragmentation at the subclump scale, which can be explained by a dynamic global collapse process. ...(2)",2024,"Whether massive starless cores exist or not is crucially important to test different models of high-mass star formation.

The IRS 17 filament, which spans ∼54,000 au (0.26 pc) in length and ∼4000 au (0.02 pc) in width, exhibits a complex, multicomponent velocity field and harbors hierarchical substructures. These substructures include three bundles of seven velocity-coherent fibers and 29 dense (n ∼ 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>‑3</SUP>) condensations. The fibers have a median length of ∼4500 au and a median width of ∼1400 au. Among these fibers, four are identified as ""fertile,"" each hosting at least three dense condensations, which are regarded as the ""seeds"" of star formation. While the detected cores are randomly spaced within the IRS 17 filament based on the 3 mm dust continuum image, periodic spacing (∼1600 au) of condensations is observed in the fertile fibers according to the 1.3 mm dust map, consistent with the predictions of linear isothermal cylinder fragmentation models. These findings underscore the crucial role of fibers in star formation and suggest a hierarchical fragmentation process that extends from the filament to the fibers and, ultimately, to the smallest-scale condensations. Leveraging the high resolution, sensitivity, and wide frequency coverage of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the QUARKS survey, standing for ""Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures"", is observing 139 massive star-forming clumps at ALMA Band 6 (λ ∼ 1.3 mm). This paper introduces the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7 m data of the QUARKS survey, describing the ACA observations and data reduction. Combining multi-wavelength data, we provide the first edition of QUARKS atlas, offering insights into the multiscale and multiphase interstellar medium in high-mass star formation. The ACA 1.3 mm catalog includes 207 continuum sources that are called ACA sources. Their gas kinetic temperatures are estimated using three formaldehyde transitions with a non-LTE radiation transfer model, and the mass and density are derived from a dust emission model. The ACA sources are massive (16–84 percentile values of 6–160 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), gravity-dominated (M ∝ R <SUP>1.1</SUP>) fragments within massive clumps, with supersonic turbulence ( ) and embedded star-forming protoclusters. We find a linear correlation between the masses of the fragments and the massive clumps, with a ratio of 6% between the two. When considering fragments as representative of dense gas, the ratio indicates a dense gas fraction (DGF) of 6%, although with a wide scatter ranging from 1% to 10%. If we consider the QUARKS massive clumps to be what is observed at various scales, then the size-independent DGF indicates a self-similar fragmentation or collapsing mode in protocluster formation. With the ACA data over four orders of magnitude of luminosity-to-mass ratio (L/M), we find that the DGF increases significantly with L/M, which indicates clump evolutionary stage. We observed a limited fragmentation at the subclump scale, which can be explained by a dynamic global collapse process. ...(2)",2024,"Whether massive starless cores exist or not is crucially important to test different models of high-mass star formation. Very massive (M>30 Msun) starless core candidates have been found in some case studies of evolved proto-stellar clusters, which may represent the very initial conditions of high-mass star formation. However, systemic searching for starless cores in proto-stellar clusters, has not been done yet. To this end, here we propose high resolution ALMA band 6 observations of a 140 high-mass proto-stellar clusters. We aim: (1) to search for candidate massive starless cores; (2) to study core mass growth by comparing the core mass functions (CMFs) for starless cores and for proto-stellar cores; (3) to investigate the effect of stellar feedback on core properties. Only through observing such a large sample one can figure out whether or not massive starless cores are common in proto-stellar clusters and what their properties are. The data will be used in the thesis works of several PhD students.",I13484-6_a_06_7M,"Zhang, Qizhou; Bronfman, Leonardo; Mardones, Diego; Evans, Neal; Stutz, Amelia; Goldsmith, Paul; Xu, Fengwei; Garay, Guido; Wang, Ke; Lu, Xing; Tej, Anandmayee; Liu, Hong-li; Li, Shanghuo; Kim, Kee-Tae; Liu, Tie; Tatematsu, Ken'ichi; Liu, Sheng-Yuan;",18.37815866362511,2024-08-21T18:10:02.819
